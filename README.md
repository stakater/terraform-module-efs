### 1. Introduction
This repository contains tooling for deploying efs in Amazon AWS using terraform and ansible.

### 2. Context
This repo is part of a parent project to achieve the ability of possibility of controlled deployments in different environments so, that we can rollback

### 3. Problem Statement 
We need infrastructure modules to be pulled by the driver pipeline to be consistent to a standard format so that it can execute them in one job and push their states to output repos.

### 4. Solution 

The solution is to pack the CI, CD, and destroy scripts consuming terraform module in ansible playbooks and provide the consistent interface to driver repo.

#### Technology Stack

* Ansible
* Bash
* Terraform

##### Infrastructure

This project can be run from any type of host with no platform restrictions. However, it was originally intended to be used by a Jenkins job.

### 5. Usage 

#### Running

0. You need to install ansible and terraform first

1. Run these,

```
$ mkdir -p build
$ touch tfvars.sh
```

2. Edit `tfvars.sh`, paste, and modify the following as needed.

_Note: S3 backend bucket needs to be created first._

```
export TF_VAR_stack_name_prefix="stakater"
export TF_VAR_environment="dev"
export TF_VAR_s3_bucket="449074299682-aurora-dev-state-store"
export TF_VAR_vpc_id="vpc-618a7307"
export TF_VAR_vpc_cidr="10.241.0.0/16"
export TF_VAR_private_subnet_ids="subnet-eafee68d,subnet-65a44b2d,subnet-0a735751"
export TF_VAR_region="eu-west-1"
